Hello, world!

I am finally setting up the page to document my learnings and reflections in my software engineering journey.

I have chosen to use GitHub pages as my platform, because this was in itself one of the projects I wanted to work on to learn and understand more about using Jekyll to generate static sites. Back in NUS, I recalled working with a coursemate who introduced me to the technology by showing me his own GitHub Pages which documented his projects and experiences. Back then, I was very impressed because many of us only had PDF resumes to document our credentials. I thought it would be cool to build one for myself but through the endless procrastination and gaming sessions, I never got around to doing it.

Since then, I have graduated and have worked as a software engineer for slightly more than 1.5 years. 

In this time, I have gone through what I believe to be a coming-of-age moment for all of us who just went through the transition of living life as a carefree university student to a working adult who has to deal with real-life problems like taking responsibility for stuff and paying your bills. 

Professionally, between the endless JIRA tickets and code reviews, I feel like I have gradually lost the excitement of building things, and I also feel like I have lost the discipline to continuously improve myself as an engineer. After all, as long as we are able to close our tickets, push the codes that we (read: ChatGPT) painstakingly designed and implemented with long-term scalability and maintainability in mind, all is good, right?

Over the last couple of months, I have reflected deeply about what I was able to bring to the table as a engineer and team member, and I have always arrived at the conclusion that there's so much more to learn and explore. Hence, I have decided to use this space to keep myself accountable, to document my goals and growth and to actively reflect on the journey ahead.
