Hello, my name is Jia Jun and I enjoy building things to solve practical, real-world problems. 

My interest in programming started back in early high school days when my friend and I stumbled upon a forum called `leetcoders.org` (yes, leetcoders, not leetcode!) where we discovered a community of online wizards who were able to build programs that could lock you out of your MSN and Facebook accounts with just your email address (read: brute force, back then there weren't things like CAPTCHA to prevent such attacks). 

Today, I enjoy learning about the complexities and thought process behind the systems and applications that appear to be simple - things that we often take for granted to simply "just work". 

These days, my main focus is on building and maintaining the Risk Platform that safeguards our user assets at Binance.
