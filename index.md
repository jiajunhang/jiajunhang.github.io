Hello, my name is Jia Jun and I enjoy building things to solve practical, real-world problems. 

My interest in programming started back in early high school days when my friend and I stumbled upon a forum called `leetcoders.org` (yes, leetcoders, not leetcode!) where we discovered a community of online wizards who were able to build programs that could lock you out of your MSN and Facebook accounts with just your email address. It was simply brute forcing the login with an obviously incorrect password. Later, as I grew up and think back on this experience, I then understood the reason why the annoying CAPTCHA exists.

Today, I enjoy learning about the complexities and thought process behind the systems and applications that appear to be simple - things that we often take for granted to simply "just work". Developing an understanding of why things are the way they are and then finally figuring out the best way to solve a problem is what drives me and keeps engineering exciting for me.
